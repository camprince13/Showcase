This project is called Super Smash Bros Stat Tracker. The purpose of this is to have multiple users input their battle stats into the program. The program would compile data to show your status, best character, and what characters are better at taking out other characters based off of everyone's status. The database for this project has shut down, however the source code is still usable.

This project was completed by the Ethereal Sloths.

The Ethereal Sloths are composed of:
