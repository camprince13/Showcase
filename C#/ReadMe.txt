---C#
 - A group of personal projects I did when I was attempting to learn new concepts, or to achieve a specific goal

BaseNumCalc - Converts a given number into multiple base forms

CustKeyGen - generates a bunch of serial keys that fit an algorithm I wrote

LightWeightSQL - a lightweight SQL app that I made when sql server could not be installed on all the work stations I was using

Note_Taker - read and write to a bunch of text files, I used it to take notes in class

PersonalEncrypter - encrypts/decrypts a bunch of files (ANSI) at the same time using a symmetric key. If something other than ANSI/ASCII is used then this program scrambles your file for you

Recipe - a program that stores recipes in a database, kind of like a digital cookbook. Needs serial key (same algorithm as Custkeygen or 25-25-25XXXX should work)

SMS_Test3 - a test application I made to see if I could text a cellphone using an email. Tested and worked with gmail and verizon.
